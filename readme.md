Roman Numeral calculator
========
This project uses RubyMotion to create a Roman Numeral calculator for the iPhone and iPad.

Actually, at this early stage it's really just a Roman Numeral adding machine, since subtraction, multiplication and division are not implemented.

Unlike other such calculators I've run across, this app does all its calculations in Roman Numerals. It doesn't convert back and forth to Arabic numerals.

(An option to display the result in Arabic numerals does now exist, but what number is shown there is calculated independently of the Roman Numeral shown in the main display.)

Runs on iOS 6.1.
